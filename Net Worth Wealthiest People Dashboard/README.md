# Net Worth Wealthiest People Dashboard

## About This Project
The purpose of this project is to create a dashboard using Microsoft Excel from a dataset containing the 1000 richest people in the world. The dataset has columns for names, countries, industries, net worth, and companies. This data created for wealth distribution analysis among billionaires in the world also gives insight into the industry and country that produces the richest individual.

The dataset contained a few columns as follows:
* Name → The name of the individual.
* Country → The country of residence or primary business operation.
* Industry → The industry in which the individual has amassed their wealth.
* Net Worth (in billions) → The estimated net worth in billions of dollars.
* Company → The primary company or business associated with the individual.

Special thanks to **"Waqar Ali"** for providing me the dataset from Kaggle.
